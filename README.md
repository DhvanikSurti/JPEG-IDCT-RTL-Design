# JPEG-IDCT-RTL-Design
Compact RTL implementation of JPEG 2D IDCT for 8Ã—8 blocks using fixed-point arithmetic. Efficient row and column transforms share hardware for low LUT usage (&lt;20K LUT4). Includes modular Verilog, pipeline-friendly design, output scaling to 8-bit pixels, and a functional testbench validating standard JPEG test vectors.
